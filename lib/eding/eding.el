;;; 
;;; SYNOPSIS
;;;
;;; eding can be used to look up words in Frank Richter's Ding
;;; German-English dictionary, to store selected words in a quiz file, and
;;; to quiz the user using an SRS challenge-response system.  The system
;;; uses sorting routines specifically designed for UTF-8 German text that
;;; may be of interest independently.
;;;
;;; PREREQUISITES
;;;
;;; The main thing you need is Frank Richter's Ding dictionary.
;;;
;;; Last time I checked the Ding dictionary was available at
;;;
;;;             http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/
;;;
;;; N.B. You only need the dictionary file. Usually there is a production
;;; version in a directory called de-en, and a development version in
;;; a directory called de-en-devel.  By the time you read this, things
;;; may have changed!  If so, you're on your own. The important thing
;;; is to get a file named de-en.txt.gz.  (So far, I have always used
;;; the one in de-en-devel, but I suspect the production version will
;;; work fine.)
;;;
;;; IMPORTANT NOTE: eding provides a routine called eding-check-dictionary
;;;                 DON'T PANIC if you run it and it finds problems in the
;;;                 dictionary. I normally find 40 to 50 problems in the
;;;                 dictionary but it doesn't keep eding from working!
;;;                 You don't need to run eding-check-dictionary.
;;;
;;; The only other thing you need is a version of Emacs that can
;;; handle UTF-8 encoding and the german-postfix input method.  
;;; Unless you are running a very old version of Emacs, you are probably
;;; all set, so you can skip down to INSTALLATION below.  If you are
;;; running an old version of Emacs, or have trouble, read the next
;;; paragraph:
;;;
;;; Your Emacs installation *has* to be able to handle utf-8 file encoding
;;; and needs to be able to handle the german-postfix input method.  If you
;;; are using an older version of Emacs, you may need to add a package
;;; containing Emacs lisp code for internationalization.  Linux
;;; distributions using older versions of Emacs generally have packages for
;;; this.  Look for a package with a name something like
;;; emacs-leim-etc. for your distribution. THE FOLLOWING FIX IS EASY AND 
;;; ALWAYS WORKS: just go to http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/ to get 
;;; Emacs 22.1 or later. It is dead easy to compile and install and simply 
;;; has everything you need built right in!
;;;
;;; INSTALLATION
;;; 
;;; QUICK START FOR THE IMPATIENT: (N.B. C-c means "control-c" below)  
;;;  
;;;    1) create a directory named ~/.eding
;;;    2) gunzip de-en.txt.gz
;;;    3) move de-en.txt to ~/.eding/de-en-devel.de
;;;       -or- move it wherever you want and put a soft
;;;            link to it named de-en-devel.de in ~/.eding.
;;;            (for example if you put it in /tmp/de-en.txt,
;;;             type
;;;                     cd ~/.eding
;;;                     ln -s /tmp/de-en.txt de-en-devel.de
;;;             and you should be all set)
;;;    4) append the file eding.el that came with the eding
;;;       distribution to the end of your ~/.emacs file. 
;;;       (If you don't have a ~/.emacs file just copy eding.el
;;;        to ~/.emacs) 
;;;    5) start Emacs
;;;    6) type C-c d h to read the built-in manual
;;;
;;; ALTERNATIVE, MORE EFFICIENT INSTALLATION
;;;
;;;    1) do steps 1) through 3) above.
;;;    2) copy the eding.el file that came with the eding
;;;       distribution to ~/.eding/eding.el
;;;    3) start Emacs
;;;    4) type:  M-x byte-compile-file <RETURN>
;;;       then:  "~/.eding/eding.el" at the prompt
;;;    5) Add this to your ~/.emacs file:
;;;
;;;                (setq load-path
;;;                      (append (list nil "~/.eding")
;;;                              load-path))
;;;
;;;                (load "eding")
;;;
;;;      (If you don't have a ~/.emacs file, just create one
;;;       with those lines in it.)
;;;    6) Re-start Emacs
;;;    7) type C-c d h to read the built-in manual

------------------------------------------------------------------
C-c d d: eding-lookup	      	   Opens the dictionary, creates a
         		      	   buffer *eding* and makes it current.
         		      	   Prompts for a \"String-Aufdruck\" 
                                   which is used as a regular expression
                                   in a regular expression search.
C-c d D: eding-lookup-soft    	   Same as C-c d d, but locally sets
         		      	   the variable eding-soft-lookup which
         		      	   causes eding-lookup to print out 
         		      	   results from *related* words in 
         		      	   addition to words that directly
         		      	   match.   Vortrefflich!
C-c d e: eding-toggle-english 	   Toggles the eding-english variable.
         		      	   This variable is nil by default.
         		      	   When non-nil, it makes the routines
         		      	   act as if the user were German.
C-c d f: eding-set-quizfile   	   Sets the filename used to store

C-c d q: eding-start-quiz     	   Starts a quiz made up from the lines

                                   file.
C-c d r: eding-randomize-quizfile  Randomizes the due dates of
                                   challenges.  Why you would want
                                   to do this is explained in the

C-c d h: eding-help	      	   Prints out a list of ding-related
         		      	   commands, the corresponding
         		      	   keystrokes, and general help.

You can get detailed help on most of these commands by
typing \"C-h f\" followed by the command name. The easy way 
to remember these (and most Emacs key bindings in general) 
is to realize that Emacs key bindings can consist of 
\"prefixes\" and command keys.  Think of C-c d as the \"Dictionary 
prefix,\" the \"Deutsch prefix,\" or even the \"Ding prefix.\"
C-c is the standard first character for user-defined commands. 
\"d\" means Dictionary, Deutch, or Ding.  Then each command is 
mnemonic. \"a\" for addline, \"h\" for help, etc. \"d\" was originally 
chosen to remind me of \"Ding lookup.\"  It is by far the most
often-used command and the double-d at the end makes it easy to
type quickly.

The rest of this help file explains the system in a general sense 
to give you a feel for using it, and describes the use of the 
eding-start-quiz function in some detail because it is, after all, 
the main reason that the system exists in the first place.

First, you can search the dictionary using eding-lookup and 
eding-soft-lookup.  These routines prompt you for a regular 
expression (Explained below if you don't know what this means. 
For now just think of it as a search string.) and print out 
parsed lines from the dictionary that match the regular expression. 
eding-lookup only prints out lines that match while eding-soft-lookup
also includes lines that don't match but are related to lines that 
do match.  The soft match can be a good way to get a better feel 
for the use of a word and to discover synonyms for words. By default,
the search searches both the German and English parts of the line,
but you can easily change this using regular expression syntax.

eding search strings are used as regular expressions for searching
the dictionary.  A regular expression is a string of characters
that describes a text pattern.  The simplest regular expressions
are just strings of letters and numbers.  A simple string like
\"Klo\" will match any line that contains the sequence of letters
\"Klo.\" (or \"klo\" for that matter...)  So if you don't want to 
bother learning about regular expressions, the program will work 
fine for you if you just type words in as search strings.

More complicated regular expressions include elements that match
word boundaries, the beginning or end of the line, etc.  They *can*
be quite complicated, but very simple regular expressions are all
you need to make your eding searches more precise. The following
table and examples will tell you all you really need to know: 
 
Rule 1: \\d (or \\D) as the first thing in your search string 
        means only look at the German side.  \\e (or \\E) as 
        the first thing means only look at the English side. 
        (N.B. this is an eding extension to regular expression 
        syntax! It is not normally available outside eding.)
Rule 2: By default regular expressions don't care much about
        case.  If you search for \"fratz\" you will get both
        fratzenhaft and Fratze. (plus some other stuff...)
Rule 3: ^ as the first thing (other than an optional \\e or
        \\d) in your search string matches the beginning of 
        the line.
Rule 4: $ as the last thing in your search string matches 
        the end of the line. You can't use it anywhere else.
        (In eding this is probably the only reason you would
        use it anyway. As of this writing there is only one
        dollar sign in the Ding dictionary and I'll bet you
        already know where it is.)
Rule 5: \\b matches a word boundary
Rule 6: [xyz] matches the character x, y, or z. (You can put
        any list of charaters you want in the brackets!)
        If the first character in the list is a caret ('^')
        it means \"match any character NOT in this list.\"
Rule 7: [^ ]* matches zero or more characters that ARE NOT
        spaces.  The asterisk means \"match zero or more
        of the thing right before me.\"  N.B.: As of this
        writing, there are NO OCCURANCES of the caret in the 
        Ding dictionary.  (Not even in the definition of 
        \"Einschaltungszeichen!\") So the only reasons you 
        should use it are for negating a bracketed character 
        list or as described in Rule 3 above. 
Rule 8: Period ('.') is a special character in regular 
        expressions which matches ANY character.  So if you
        want to search for something that has a period in
        it (the dictionary has many abbreviations in it!)
        you need to \"escape\" the period with a backslash.
        If you want to know what \"d.h.\" stands for, you 
        need to search for \"d\\.h\\.\" or you will get about
        two thousand results including daheim, daher, etc. 

Examples:

SEARCH STRING     FINDS LINES THAT
----------------------------------------------------------
streng            have German or English words containing 
                  \"streng\"   
\\dstreng          have German words containing \"streng\"
\\estreng          have English words containing \"streng\"
\\d^streng         have a German side starting with \"streng\"
\\d\\bstreng        have German words that start with \"streng\"
\\dstreng\\b        have German words that end with \"streng\"
                  (Note that most German entries end with 
                  a designation of gender or part of speech,
                  e.g. {m} to denote a masculine noun.  Thus
                  if you are looking for German words that 
                  end a certain way it is much better to use
                  \\b than it is to use $ at the end!)
\\d\\bkla[^ ]*ch\\b  have German words that start with \"kla\" 
                  and end with \"ch\" (like Kladderadatsch!)
\\d^kl[Ã¤Ã¼]         have a German side that starts with \"klÃ¤\"
                  or \"klÃ¼\"

As you can see, regular expressions are very powerful, and
we've only scratched the surface here. You can learn more about 
them by reading the Emacs documentation.

The lines found by the lookup routines are printed in 
alphabetical order in a special buffer named *eding* which is 
created if it doesn't already exist.

The sorting routine emulates the approach used by my Brockhaus 
dictionary when alphabetizing. In the Brockhaus approach, 'Ã¤' 
is essentially equivalent to 'a' but follows 'a' if the words 
are otherwise the same alphabetically.  Thus trÃ¤ge follows 
trage but Tragetasche follows TrÃ¤gerwelle. 

Once you have some lines in the *eding* buffer, you can
automatically add lines to a quiz file using the function
eding-quiz-addline.  Just move the cursor to a line you
want to add and type \"C-c d a.\" This copies the line
to your quiz file.  See the documentation for this 
function (by typing \"C-h f <return> eding-quiz-addline\")
for tips on improving your quiz file.

Once you have a bunch of lines in your quiz file, you
can quiz yourself periodically to ingrain the words 
you have learned into your vocabulary. It's pretty 
amazing how fast and well you can learn a lot of words
if you do just one quiz session (usually about 20 minutes)
each day.  You start the quiz by typing \"C-c d q.\"

The quiz routine implements an SRS system which schedules
challenges based on your past performance in responding to
them.  The system is designed to rate your performance 
based on speed of response. The idea is simple: The computer 
prints out a challenge and starts a timer.  Once you have 
read the challenge and stated the correct response out loud, 
you hit return and the computer stops the timer.  Since the
challenge generally has at most a handful of words or phrases
to read and respond to, the system assumes that any response 
that takes more than 5 seconds to respond to is a problem for
you. (This value is actually variable and you can control
it by modifying the value of prob-thresh in the code.)
Any challenge that gives you trouble is automatically 
added to a list of challenges that will be re-presented 
after you have gone through the entire quiz once.  These 
problem challenges will be re-presented over and over until 
you can respond to them in less than 5 seconds.

The program automatically keeps track of your performance
and stores it in the quiz file.  For each quiz session, 
however, only your initial response to a challenge is stored.
The secondary phase where you are presented with problem
challenges is just there to help you learn the information
so you can do better next time.

Here are some important things to know about how the quiz
works:

  1) The computer measures your response time, but you
     can overrule this measurement by typing in a number.
     This is really meant for interruptions like a 
     ringing phone or crying child.  It is probably 
     better not to override the data for any other 
     reason except:

  2) If you override the data by typing any number that
     is greater than 10 you will reset the challenge.
     This resets the iteration number of the challenge
     to 0 and the average score to 11.0, which assures
     that the question will be asked every session 
     until you get the average score below 3.0.
     (also variable.  See crit-thresh in the code)

  3) Yes, that's right. 3.0.  This is because the system
     also considers any challenge that takes you more than
     3 seconds to answer (on average) to be a problem for 
     you. (Remember, this is language, you need to get it
     virtually instantly to be fluent!)  The scheduling
     algorithm always includes any words that have
     average scores over crit-thresh even if it bumps off
     challenges that are due.

  4) The quiz is set up assuming you have a pretty big
     quiz file.  By default it assumes you will want to
     be challenged about 250 times in a session, which
     usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes.

  5) The program makes sure you see all of your challenges
     on a regular basis, but is skewed to show you the
     ones with the highest scores (high being bad here,
     since it is your average response time) more often.
     However, if you do multiple sessions in one day
     it will not re-present challenges that were
     presented within the previous six hours.

  6) For best results in setting up your quiz file, see 
     the help for eding-quiz-addline!

  7) You don't need to use the standard quiz file location
     and/or you can have more than one. The currently active 
     quiz filename can be found by typing \"C-h v eding-quiz-file.\"  
     You can set this variable using the command 
     \"C-c d f\" (eding-set-quizfile). N.B.: quiz files
     *must* use utf-8 coding for the program to work right!

  8) By default the system assumes that the user is an 
     English speaker learning German unless the variable 
     eding-english is set non-nil.  As of this writing, 
     setting eding-english non-nil has not been extensively
     tested.  See eding-toggle-english, but if you are a
     German that wants to use the system, it is probably
     better to change the defvar for eding-english....

  9) There is more detailed information about customization
     in the comments to the source code.

 10) If you have gotten this far you must be very dedicated,
     so here are a few more pro tips:

     a) Read German mystery/detective novels and romance novels. 
        These have lots of dialog and provide examples of how 
        people really talk in common situations so they help
        develop your SprachgefÃ¼hl. The first couple will 
        probably take a while to get through, but once you have 
        read about a half dozen you will be able to read just 
        about anything with just a little help from eding, and
        your reading speed will be much faster.  Also, these
        are easy to find at very low prices at used book stores!

     b) Keep a half-dozen Post-it notes on the inside back 
        cover of any novel you are reading.  Whenever you 
        come to a word or phrase that you aren't sure about, 
        mark it with a Post-it note. Unless it is critically
        important for you to know exactly what the word
        means, try to figure it out from the context and
        delay looking it up. Wait and see if something later
        in the text helps clue you in. You may learn the
        language more throuroughly if you absorb it rather
        than treat it as a table-lookup exercise.  
        Later, when you have amassed a few Post-its, look 
        them up with eding and add them to your quiz file. 
        (The Post-it note trick is also useful for books 
        written in your native language!)   

     c) Read http://www.heute.de every day, with an Emacs
        window open under your browser so you can look up and 
        add interesting words to your quiz file on the fly. This
        site provides lots of examples of contemporary usage
        and is written in simple language. 

     d) There is a website called redensarten-index
        (http://www.redensarten-index.de/suche.php) that
        is great for looking up idioms you might come
        across.")

If the mark is active, this function adds all the lines

You can set the filename of the current quiz file using
the command \"C-c d f\" (eding-set-quizfile)

N.B.: eding-quiz-addline is great for adding lines to 
your quiz file, but it is also a great way for you to
add lines to your quizfile which you subsequently edit
to end up with a better quizfile.  Here is an example.
Say you look up \"Unterscheidung.\" One of the lines
you get will be:

Unterscheidung {f} <---> distinction

but you realize you already have this line in your
quiz file:

Unterschied {m} <---> distinction

I don't have a function for this (yet) but what I do in
this case is type \"C-c d a\" to add the first line
and then combine the two lines manually in the quiz
file to give me:

Unterschied {m}, Unterscheidung {f} <---> distinction (GIVE 2!)

Keep in mind that the *eding* buffer is editable. Thus
you can edit and/or combine lines as you look them up
*before* you type C-c d a to store them in the quiz file.

One final note:  I have a number of words in my quiz file 
that have (GIVE 5!) on them, but it can be difficult to blurt
out 5 words or phrases in less than three seconds, even if you 
know them well.  So until you have some experience using the 
system it is probably better not to make your challenges *too* 
challenging."
